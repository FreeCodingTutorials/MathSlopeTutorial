# Slope v1.3

A collection of materials required to run Slope v1.3 entirely hosted off of your own PC, compiled from https://unblockeds-games.com/webgl/slope/

**Slope Discord Server: https://discord.gg/FyWTeZBYkp**

## Reasons for playing Slope this way:

Many top players of the game, including current and former world record holders, have tested many different versions of Slope from across the internet.

We have deduced that by running Slope whilst it is hosted off of your own PC, the amount of game breaking glitches you get (such as bounces and control grabs) and lag is greatly reduced.

## How To Run

### 1. Download Servez
Servez is an app which allows you to run a simple web server off of your PC. Servez features a simple to use GUI for those who are not familiar with/not comfortable with using a CLI to set up a simple web server.

Download `.exe` if you are on Windows, and `.dmg` if you are on MacOS.

### 3. Running the web server
Launch Servez, then choose the location of the cloned files via the three elipses next to `Folder to Serve`.

Leave the port as **"8080"**, and ensure that **"Support Unity"** is selected among the tick boxes.

Once that is set up, press **"Launch Browser"**. This should launch Slope in your browser of choice, hosted off of your PC.
